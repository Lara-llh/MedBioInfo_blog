Workflow managers allow you to develop an automated pipeline from your scripts that can then be run on a variety of systems.

The manager then coordinates the deployment of the scripts in the appropriate sequence, monitors the jobs, handles the file transfers between scripts, gathers the output, and handles re-execution of failed jobs for you. Workflow managed pipelines can run containers, which eliminates software installation and version conflicts.

There are two main workflow managers: [snakemake](https://www.snakemake.io) and [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io).

## **Nextflow**
In nextflow, your scripts are turned into processes, connected by channels that contain the data - input, output etc. The order of the processes, and their interaction with each other, is specfied in the workflow scope.

Important things about nextflow:
- 1. The `script` can be written in any language. - The modularity of the process allows to re-use existing scripts and processes easily. 
- 2. The functional processes are separated from the executive ones, therefore the pipelines are higly interoperable and portable. 
- 3. Pipelines can be very reproducible if they are integrated with version control tools (like git or bitbucket) and container technologies (apptainer or docker).
- 4. They are scalable, you can strat testing with just a couple of samples and easily scale up to hundreds or thusands. Processes are run in parallele automatically when possible. 
- 5. It resumes executions. Autimatically checks the processes and can resume from a point of failure without having to re-compute already completed parts. 
- 6. It's open source.
