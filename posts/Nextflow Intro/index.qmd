Workflow managers allow you to develop an automated pipeline from your scripts that can then be run on a variety of systems.

The manager then coordinates the deployment of the scripts in the appropriate sequence, monitors the jobs, handles the file transfers between scripts, gathers the output, and handles re-execution of failed jobs for you. Workflow managed pipelines can run containers, which eliminates software installation and version conflicts.

There are two main workflow managers: [snakemake](https://www.snakemake.io) and [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io).

## **Netflow**
In nextflow, your scripts are turned into processes, connected by channels that contain the data - input, output etc. The order of the processes, and their interaction with each other, is specfied in the workflow scope.
