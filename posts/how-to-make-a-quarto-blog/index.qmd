In this post we are going to learn how to create a Quarto blog. 

# **Part 1: Create the blog**

The first step is to  create a Quarto blog project. In order to do so, you go to View and open the Command Palette in VScode and then type Quarto: Create Project. Select Blog project and choose the name and location in your computer. 

# **Part 2: Edit** 

Create a new post by generating a new folder in the posts folder of your Quarto blog. 
Inside this new folder create a new index.qmd file. 

This file should contain some variations of the following information between two lines of ---:

- title: "Title" 
- author: "your name"
- date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- categories: []
- image: "image.jpg"

After this coding information you include the content you want to have in your blog. 

There is a lot of options for the code. Some useful resorces to explore the different alternatives that you can integrate in your code are: 

- [Listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html)
- [Executable code](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html)
- [Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)
- [Images formating / Lightbox figures](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-lightbox-figures.html)

# **Part 3: Publish your blog**

git pwd - you have to make sure you are working in the directory of your blog

git cd "directory" - if you need to set the working directory

git init - to initialize the blog directory as a git repository

git status - to check 

git remote add origin git@github.com:user/blogname.git

quarto render

quarto publish gh-pages 




### Add the blog to GitHub using GitHub Actions

Enter your GitHub account and create a new repository

git add --all - to add all the untracked files (shown with the git status command) to the repository

git commit -m "message to track the changes" - to commit all the changes made

git push -u origin main
